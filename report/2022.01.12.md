# Common units and Unit Conversions 
- Given imperial or other Units convert to "pure" SI 
- Do all calculatuons in SI 
- Common SI units (Distance meter , Mass  kilogram , Time seconds , Force N = kg*m/s^2 , Speed = m/s , Acc
- eleration = m/s^2 , Energy = j , power = watts ) 
- Electric cuurent A (amperes) , Charge , c (coulombs) , Electric Potential or Volatage , Force N Newton ) 

# Grade Force  
- F(grade) = M(vech)g sin Ã¥

# Rolling Resistance 

-F(RR)  = sgn(veh)M(veh)
